            <p>
                Our goal is to develop a website that offers up-to-date weather information, using different APIs to provide accurate and real-time data on weather phenomena, natural disasters and weather forecasts. We believe that this approach is not only fascinating, but also very relevant in today's world.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Each of us brings something unique to the team, from design and programming to content creation. We work together to ensure that the website is visually appealing, easy to navigate and that the information is clear and accessible to all.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                We are very excited about this project and the opportunity to learn and grow together. We hope that our website will not only inform, but also inspire others to take an interest in meteorology and science. We thank everyone for visiting our site and hope you enjoy our work as much as we enjoyed creating it.

            <h2 class="color-h3">Color Guide</h2>
            <p>
                When creating our weather page, we selected a palette that includes <b>Soft White (#e6e6fd)</b>, <b>Midnight Blue (#1C1C5A)</b>, <b>Soft Purple (#9370DB)</b> and <b>Ice Blue (#B0E0E6)</b>. Choosing the right colours is key to a pleasant and effective user experience.
            </p><br>
            <div class="color-box-soft" style="background-color: #e6e6fd;">
                <span>Soft White #e6e6fd</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Soft White is ideal as a background, as it brings clarity and freshness. This tone makes text and graphics easy to read, creating a welcoming environment for users.
            </p><br>
            <div class="color-box" style="background-color: #1C1C5A;">
                <span>Midnight Blue #1C1C5A</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Midnight blue reminds us of the sky and brings a sense of calm and seriousness. We use it in headings and menus to make them easily visible, which generates confidence in the information presented.
            </p><br>
            <div class="color-box" style="background-color: #9370DB;">
                <span>Soft Purple #9370DB</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Soft Purple adds modernity and creativity to the design. It is used on buttons and links to make them eye-catching without being obtrusive, guiding users to important areas of the page.
            </p><br>
            <div class="color-box-soft" style="background-color: #B0E0E6;">
                <span>Ice Blue #B0E0E6</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Ice blue represents water and cold, perfect for visualising weather data. This colour, like the soft white, brings calmness and makes information accessible and easy to understand.
            </p><br>
            <h3 class="color-h3">Colour Selection Process</h3>
            <p>
                To select the colours, we used an AI that gave us several weather-related options. After evaluation, we chose the ones we liked the most and that worked best together.
            </p><br>
            <h3 class="color-h3">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The chosen palette combines style and functionality. Soft White, Midnight Blue, Soft Purple and Ice Blue not only look good, but also enhance the clarity and accessibility of weather information.
